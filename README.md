## Feeling

Nuxt.js is a automatic tool can be used for integrate vue, vue-router and vuex automatically.

It do a framework's work, define some rules and serving for who obeyed its rules.

Layout defines page framework, components just like normal meaning, pages are many web pages and their name would be urls. If store is defined, vuex will be injected automatically, and you can commit action at anywhere just like normal use.

Its most benefit is that you do not need to configure such a workspace by yourself, you just write a single page, and it will work for you, like route, create page with template, etc.
